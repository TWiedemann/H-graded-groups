The GAP code in this repository contains several computations that support the paper "Root graded groups of type $H_3$ and $H_4$" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06745) by Lennart Berg and Torben Wiedemann. We refer to this paper by [BW] in the code.
1. The folder `Blueprint computations` contains the code for the blueprint computations (see [BW, Sections 7 and 8]) and the results of these computations (in tex, pdf and txt format).
2. The folder `Auxiliary computations` contains all remaining computations for various claims. In particular, it contains:
   (a) The realisation of the root systems $H_3$ and $H_4$ as foldings of $D_6$ and $E_8$, respectively.
   (b) The construction of an $H_4$-graded group from a Chevalley group of type $D_6$, of an $H_3$-graded group from a Chevalley group of type $E_8$, and computations in this group.
